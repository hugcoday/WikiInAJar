Upgrading to a new version of ''Wiki in a jar'' is pretty easy:

# Extract the new Wiki in a jar version to a new directory
## Should you have started your new Wiki already, stop it first and then continue with the next step.
## Before you stop it, make a copy of these instructions or read and understand the steps now (once you stop the Wiki, this page will be unavailable).
# Delete the data directory of the '''new''' Wiki in a jar version (this will be replaced with your old, actual Wiki documents)
## The directory is: ''<wiki install dir>/public/docs''
# Now copy the data directory from your old Wiki installation to the new version:
## Copy ''<OLD wiki install dir>/public/docs'' to <NEW wiki install dir>/public/docs''
# Start your new Wiki version and it will use the files you just copied.

Note: It is also a good idea to backup your Wiki files in ''public/docs'' on a regular basis. Hard drives tend to break exactly at the least convenient time.
